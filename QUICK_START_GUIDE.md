# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - First Time Setup

You're seeing registration errors because you need to set up the system first. Here's how:

## Step 1: Create First Admin User

1. **Go back to the Login page** (click "Giriş yapın" at the bottom)
2. **Look for the "İlk Kurulum" section** at the bottom of the login page
3. **Click "🚀 İlk Kurulum (Admin Oluştur)"** button
4. **Fill out the admin form** with your details
5. **Click "Admin Hesabı Oluştur"**

## Step 2: Login as Admin

1. **Use your admin credentials** to login
2. **You'll see the dashboard** with admin privileges

## Step 3: Create Referral Codes

1. **Go to "Referans Kodları"** in the left sidebar
2. **Click "Yeni Kod Oluştur"**
3. **Add trainer name** (optional) and notes
4. **Click "Kodu Oluştur"**
5. **Copy the 8-character code** that's generated

## Step 4: Share Codes with Trainers

1. **Give the referral code** to trainers who need to register
2. **They can now use the registration form** with the code
3. **The code will be automatically marked as used**

## Current Issue Solution

The error "Referral kodu doğrulanırken bir hata oluştu" happens because:
- There are no referral codes in the system yet
- You need to create an admin first
- Then the admin creates referral codes

**Quick Fix:** Use the "İlk Kurulum" option on the login page to create your first admin user, then create referral codes from the admin dashboard.

## System Flow

```
1. Create Admin (İlk Kurulum) → 
2. Login as Admin → 
3. Create Referral Codes → 
4. Share with Trainers → 
5. Trainers Register with Codes
```

This ensures only authorized trainers can register while keeping the process simple!
